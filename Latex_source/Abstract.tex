\label{Abstract}
Since most multi-story buildings such as apartments, condominiums, office buildings, etc have a centralized post-box location, users are limited on how often they can visit to check or collect their post. In order to determine whether they have any new posts or letters in their post-box, they must periodically check it speculatively. Most users neglect to check their post boxes. As a consequence, sometimes important letters go unnoticed, resulting in various miseries. Since official letters are becoming more widely used worldwide due to their high level of confidentiality, users are seeking a better solution that will keep them on their toes when receiving posts. The goal of this project is to create a smart post-box. In this case, the post-box is designed to notify the recipient when a post has been delivered and to provide access to the right person. This project used an ultrasonic sensor, which is connected to NodeMCU, that is used to detect objects inside the post-box, SMTP which is used to notify users about the new arrival of a post in the post-box by email, and Firebase which is used to store real-time data of distance between sensor and object.
