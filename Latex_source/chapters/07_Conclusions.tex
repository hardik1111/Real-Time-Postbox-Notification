As smartphones and computers are very common gadgets for one’s daily life. IoT is not just a concept anymore, it is already a major part of our lives, and it is getting more and more involved in our lives, and with this project, it will help us in the future.

The Smart post-box with real-time email notification is designed such that users will be notified as soon as a new post arrives. The entire real-time system works as data is received from the ultrasonic sensor located inside of the mailbox. As the new post is detected by the ultrasonic sensor, the NodeMCU transmits the data to the Firebase database and an email notification is sent via the SMTP mail function. We have used SMTP because it has no sending volume limit and fully monitors email delivery, although it consumes more time, money, and effort for a small-scale project, we can ignore this disadvantage. As e-mail has become an integral part of everyone’s day-to-day life this system will provide users with various benefits.
